# Gordy's NIXOS System!

A _lot_ of this is teken from Vimjoyer's setup [here](https://github.com/vimjoyer/nixconf/tree/main)

Can also check out his Youtube video "Ultimate NixOS Guide | Flakes | Home-manager". Avoid older videos; they do not use a modular setup and you _will_ get even more confused.

## Building the OS

Run:

`home-manager switch`
